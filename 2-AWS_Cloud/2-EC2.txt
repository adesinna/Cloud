# You can use cost and billings to set up budgets, just not to spend more than expected

 Ec2 are virtual machines, this is the IAAS for AWS

 Userdata are script that are used when booting



EC2 Instance Types
    General Purpose:
        Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories

    Compute Optimized:
        Great for compute intensive tasks that require high performance


    Memory Optimized:
        Great for fast performance for large data sets in memory (databases)


    Storage Optimized:
        Great for storage intensive task that require high, sequential read write access
        to large data.


Security Groups:
    Are the rules that controls the firewalls. You can specify ports, even other security groups

    Inbound rules: Are rules that are allowed for incoming traffic
    Outbound rules: Are rules that are allowed for out-coming traffic

    - SG can be attached to multiple instances
    - Locked down to region/VPC combination

    ssh -i key.pem user@ip # how to ssh

    You can attached role to EC2
    This allows the ec2 to do some operations in the instance

    Roles > Attach it to the instances


Purchasing Options
    On demand Instances: Short workload pay by seconds

    Reserved(1&3 years): Long Workloads

    Savings Plan(1&3 years): Committed amount of usage for long workloads

    Spot Instances: Short workloads, and can lose it anytime # like spot prices in trading

    Dedicated Host: Gives you a dedicated for you, it is quite expensive


Private vs Public vs Elastic IP
    Public allows you to talk over the internet

    Private allows you to be identified inside a VPC

    NAT gateway allows private IP to talk to the internet

    Elastic IP address allows you to mask the failure of an instance to another one
    so the ip of the infrastructure doesnt change, but the instance might


Placement Groups
    Cluster:
        All your EC2 instances would be in the same zone.
        It allows great bandwidth, but if the zone fails all fails

    Spread:
        The Ec2 instances would be distributed across different zones,
        but you can only use 7 per zone

    Partition:
        It putting instances in a rack in same and different zones




    Network & Security >  Placement Group > Choose your strategy



Elastic Network Interface(ENI):
    Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.
    They give private and public address and can be more than one ENI
    It can be move from one instance to another
