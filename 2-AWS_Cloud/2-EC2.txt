EC2 Instance Types
    General Purpose:
        Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories

    Compute Optimized:
        Great for compute intensive tasks that require high performance


    Memory Optimized:
        Great for fast performance for large data sets in memory (databases)
