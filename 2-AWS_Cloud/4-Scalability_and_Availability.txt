Scalability:
    This is the ability to provide more infrastructure.
        Horizontal Scalability:
            More units are provided to the one that is available, that another machine is provisioned to join the
            already available machine. You can scale out or in

        Vertical Scalability:
            The machine is changed, and replaced with a stronger or weaker machine. You can scale up or down



Load Balancing:
    They are servers that spread the traffic to multiple instances

    Health checks allows the load balancer check whether an instance is healthy or not

    Types of Load Balances
        Classic Load Balancers:
            HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL

        Application Load Balancer:
            HTTP, HTTPS, Websockets
            They route based on name, one name can route to the ones on cloud
            while the other sends them to the on prem center

        Network Load Balancer:
            TCP, TLS, UDP
            They can handle millions of request by sec
            It can use static ips


        Gateway Load Balancer:
            Operates in the Layer 3 (Network Layer)
            They can inspect the traffic before it reaches your targets



    Stickiness:
        It makes sure the load balance always route the user to the same instance behind the load balancer


    Cross Zone Load Balancing
        This is when you use to load balancer to send this across az


    SSL/TLS Certificates
        SNI allows use different target groups for multiple certificates. # for ALB and NLB

    Draining Connection
        It allows deregistered instances to finish they request, before deleting them


    Auto Scaling Group
        This allows you to scale, horizontally
        It can use cloud watch to scale too
