1. What is cloud computing ?

This is the delivery of a shared pool of on-demand computing services over the public internet, that can be rapidly
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or servie provider interaction.


Characteristics of cloud

- On-demand Self Service

    Provision resources automatically without requiring human interaction

- Broad Network Access

    It is available over the network, so you can connect from anywhere

- Resource Pooling

    Pooled resources to support a multi-tenant model allowing multiple customers to share the same applications or
    the same physical infrastructure.


- Rapid Elasticity

    Rapidly provision and de-provision any of the cloud computing resources


- Measured Service
    Resource usage can be monitored, controlled and reported using metering capabilities.



2. Cloud Deployment Models


Public Cloud:
    This is a cloud that the infrastructure can be connected to over the internet i.e AWS, GCP and AZURE


Multiple Cloud:
    This is when you use more than one public cloud

    This might be used to prevent vendor locking or for disaster recovery
