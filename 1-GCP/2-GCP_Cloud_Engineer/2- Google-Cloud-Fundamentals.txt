1. Google Cloud Global Infrastructure

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has a global infrastructure that consists of data centers and network points of presence
(PoPs) strategically located around the world.
The infrastructure is designed to provide high-performance and reliable services to users and businesses


Data Centers:
    Google Cloud operates numerous data centers globally. These data centers house the physical hardware,
    including servers, storage, and networking equipment, that form the backbone of the cloud infrastructure.
    Data centers are located in various regions and zones, allowing users to deploy resources in proximity to their
    target audience or to meet specific compliance requirements.

Regions and Zones:
    Google Cloud is organized into regions, which are geographic areas that contain one or more data centers.
    Each region is further divided into zones, which are isolated locations within a region. The use of regions and
    zones enables users to create highly available and resilient applications by distributing resources across different geographic locations.


Network Backbone:
    Google Cloud's global network is a high-speed, low-latency infrastructure that connects data centers
    worldwide. The backbone is designed to ensure fast and reliable data transfer between regions and zones.
    This global network is a crucial component for delivering services with high performance and availability.


Edge Locations and Points of Presence (PoPs):
    Google Cloud has a network of edge locations and PoPs situated at strategic locations around the world.
    These locations help in caching content and reducing latency for end-users accessing Google Cloud services.
    Google Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network) leverages these edge locations to optimize content delivery.


Interconnects:
    Google Cloud offers various options for connecting on-premises data centers to its cloud infrastructure.
    Dedicated Interconnect and Partner Interconnect are services that provide direct and reliable connections between
    an organization's network and the Google Cloud network.

Security Infrastructure:
    Google Cloud places a strong emphasis on security, and its infrastructure includes various features to ensure the
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data. This includes encryption, identity and access
    management, and various security certifications and compliance standards.


2. Compute Service Options

Computer Engine (IAAS):
    This contains virtual machines called instances, which can be deployed in any chosen region and zone.
    You decide the operating system and the software you decide to put on it.

    You can use public or private images to create instances.

    Managing multiple instances using instance groups, add or remove capacity using autoscaling with instance groups

    Disk can be attached to these instances, and  you can use  storage services.

    SSH can be used to access these instances



Google Kubernetes Engine (CAAS):
    Container orchestration system for automating deploying, scaling and managing containers

    This is built on the open source k8 project

    Flexibility to integrate with on prem Kubernetes

    Uses Compute Engine instances as nodes in a cluster





App Engine (PAAS):
    Fully managed, serverless platform developing and hosting web applications at scale (PAAS)

    GCP provisions servers and scales your app instances based on demand, so all you need to be concerned is your code
    And it allows you to connect to other Google service like databases and storages.



Cloud Functions (FAAS):
    This is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. They are event based, to they
    can be triggered based on an event.

    It watches an event like pdf upload, you can write a function in python to convert it to word or something.
    It is based on an event.



Cloud Run (FAAS):
    This is a fully managed compute platform for deploying and scaling containerized applications quickly and securely.
    This is a serverless compute for containers



3. Storage and Databases

Storage:
    -Cloud Storage:
        This is google's consistent, scalable, large-capacity, highly durable object storage (document or pictures).

        It is durable and has unlimited storage

        It has four storage types

            - Standard  ( no limit)
            - Nearline  ( < 1/Month)
            - Coldline  ( < 1/3months)
            - Archive   ( < 1/yr)     # note the cost decreases down the group


        It can be stored in

            - Single Region
            - Dual Region
            - Multiple Region

        Use Cases
            - Content Delivery
            - Data Lakes
            - Backups

    - Filestore
        This is a fully managed NFS file server. Data can be stored from multiple VM instances and Kubernetes clusters
        This is good when you need a group of instance to access same data.

        Kubernetes cluster is used for this.



    - Persistent Disks
        Durable block storage that are connected to an operating system

        It can be stored in

            -Standard
            - SSD  # this is faster than standard

Databases:
    Relational

        - Cloud SQL:
            This is a fully manages database service, PostgreSQL, mySQL and SQL servers which have high availabilty across
            zone

        - Cloud Spanner:
            Scalable relational database service. Supports transactions, strong consistency and synchronous replication

            Highly available across regions and globally



    Non-Relational

        - Big Table:
            This is a fully managed, scalable, NoSQL database. It has high through put with low latency and cluster resizing
            without any downtime


        - Datastore:
            This is a serverless, fast and fully managed NOsql document databases

            For mobile, web and IoT apps, with multi-region replication


        - Firestore
            NO SQL, real time database

            Optimized for offline use

            Cluster resizing without any downtime


        - Memorystore
            Highly available caching service



Networking Services:
    - VPC
        Virtualized network within Google Cloud

        Network cannot be shared within projects

    - Firewall Rules
        These are like security groups in AWS, they control the traffic


    - Routes
        This shows how packets should be distributed




    - Load Balancing

        HTTPS LB

            This distributes traffic across regions to ensure that request are routed to the closest region or in the
            event of a failure or over capacity, to a healthy instance in the next closest region


        Network LB
            This traffic is distributed among instances in the same region based on incoming IP protocol data, such as
            address, port or protocol.

    - Google Cloud DNS

        Publish and maintain DNS records by using the same infrastructure that google uses.


    - Advanced connectivity

        Cloud VPN
            Connects your existing network to your VPC network through an IPSEC connection over the internet

        Direct interconnect
            It does connect your existing network to your vpc without using the internet, and this makes it highly available



        Direct Peering
            Exchange internet traffic between your business network and Google at one of google edge network location


        Carrier Peering
            Connect your infrastructure to Google's network edge through highly available connections using a 3rd party carrier
