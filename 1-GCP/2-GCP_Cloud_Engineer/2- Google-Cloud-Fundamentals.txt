1. Google Cloud Global Infrastructure

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has a global infrastructure that consists of data centers and network points of presence
(PoPs) strategically located around the world.
The infrastructure is designed to provide high-performance and reliable services to users and businesses


Data Centers:
    Google Cloud operates numerous data centers globally. These data centers house the physical hardware,
    including servers, storage, and networking equipment, that form the backbone of the cloud infrastructure.
    Data centers are located in various regions and zones, allowing users to deploy resources in proximity to their
    target audience or to meet specific compliance requirements.

Regions and Zones:
    Google Cloud is organized into regions, which are geographic areas that contain one or more data centers.
    Each region is further divided into zones, which are isolated locations within a region. The use of regions and
    zones enables users to create highly available and resilient applications by distributing resources across different geographic locations.


Network Backbone:
    Google Cloud's global network is a high-speed, low-latency infrastructure that connects data centers
    worldwide. The backbone is designed to ensure fast and reliable data transfer between regions and zones.
    This global network is a crucial component for delivering services with high performance and availability.


Edge Locations and Points of Presence (PoPs):
    Google Cloud has a network of edge locations and PoPs situated at strategic locations around the world.
    These locations help in caching content and reducing latency for end-users accessing Google Cloud services.
    Google Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network) leverages these edge locations to optimize content delivery.


Interconnects:
    Google Cloud offers various options for connecting on-premises data centers to its cloud infrastructure.
    Dedicated Interconnect and Partner Interconnect are services that provide direct and reliable connections between
    an organization's network and the Google Cloud network.

Security Infrastructure:
    Google Cloud places a strong emphasis on security, and its infrastructure includes various features to ensure the
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data. This includes encryption, identity and access
    management, and various security certifications and compliance standards.


2. Compute Service Options

Computer Engine (IAAS):
    This contains virtual machines called instances, which can be deployed in any chosen region and zone.
    You decide the operating system and the software you decide to put on it.

    You can use public or private images to create instances.

    Managing multiple instances using instance groups, add or remove capacity using autoscaling with instance groups

    Disk can be attached to these instances, and  you can use  storage services.

    SSH can be used to access these instances



Google Kubernetes Engine (CAAS):
    Container orchestration system for automating deploying, scaling and managing containers

    This is built on the open source k8 project

    Flexibilty to integrate with on prem Kubernetes

    Uses Compute Engine instances as nodes in a cluster





App Engine (PAAS):
    Fully managed, serverless platform developing and hosting web applications at scale (PAAS)

    GCP provisions servers and scales your app instances based on demand, so all you need to be concerned is your code
    And it allows you to connect to other Google service like databases and storages.



Cloud Functions (FAAS):
    This is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. They are event based, to they
    can be triggered based on an event.



Cloud Run (FAAS):
    This is a fully managed compute platform for deploying and scaling containerized applications quickly and securely.
    This is a serverless compute for containers
