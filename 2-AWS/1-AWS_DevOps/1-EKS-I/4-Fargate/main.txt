AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). With Fargate, you don't need to manage or provision servers,
as it allows you to run containers without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.


Here are the key aspects of Fargate:

Serverless Containers:
    Fargate automatically allocates the necessary compute resources to run containers,
    eliminating the need to manage EC2 instances.

Seamless Scaling:
    It scales up or down automatically depending on the needs of your containers,
    providing the right amount of compute capacity for your workloads.

Isolation:
    Each Fargate task or pod runs in its own isolated environment,
    providing enhanced security.

Cost Efficiency:
    You pay only for the resources your containers use, which includes vCPU and memory.
    This can be more cost-effective for certain types of workloads compared to traditional EC2-based hosting.

Integration with ECS and EKS:
    Fargate can be used with both ECS and EKS, providing flexibility in how
    you manage your containerized applications.

Fargate is particularly useful when you want to focus on developing and deploying applications
rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. It is ideal for running microservices, batch processing,
and other containerized workloads in a serverless environment.
