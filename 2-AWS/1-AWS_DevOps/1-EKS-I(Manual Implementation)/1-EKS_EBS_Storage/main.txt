We have 3 major types of storage on aws for the kubernetes

- EBS
- EFS
- FSx for Luster CSI

For this lecture, we are going to be using EBS CSI driver for persistent
storage for mysql

EBS provides block storage for EC2 and containers instances on aws, they can be detached
and would persist independently.

It is situable for database style application that rely on random reads and writes.


Step 1: Create IAM policy for EBS

    Go to Services -> IAM
    Create a Policy
    Select JSON tab and copy and paste the 1-policy.json
    Click on Review Policy
    Name: Amazon_EBS_CSI_Driver
    Description: Policy for EC2 Instances to access Elastic Block Store
    Click on Create Policy


Step 2: We associate the role to the worker node
    This would allow the pods to access the ebs volume that was created

    1. Get Worker node IAM Role ARN
        kubectl -n kube-system describe configmap aws-auth

    2. Copy the rolearn
        # this is how it looks like
        arn:aws:iam::479465295367:role/eksctl-test1-nodegroup-test1-ng-pu-NodeInstanceRole-EN7F3UXG23F

    3. Attach the policy to that role   #roles refer to sets of permissions that grant entities (like users, services, or applications) access to AWS resources.

        Go to Services -> IAM -> Roles
        Search for role with name eksctl-test1-nodegroup and open it
        Click on Permissions tab
        Click on Attach Policies
        Search for Amazon_EBS_CSI_Driver and click on Attach Policy

Step 3: Deploy EBS CSI driver

        # Deploy EBS
        kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=master"

        # Verify ebs-csi pods running
        kubectl get pods -n kube-system


Step 4
    Deploy the manifest

    And dont forget to encode the secrets


# sometimes apps might not run because of the limit constraint
