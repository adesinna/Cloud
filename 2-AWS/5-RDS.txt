This stands for Relational Database Service

    - Postgres
    - MySQL
    - MariaDB
    - Oracle
    - Mircosoft SQL Server
    - IBM DB2
    - Aurora (AWS owned)

RDS is managed by aws and it is better than provisioning manually
It would automatically back it up.


Read Replicas and Multi AZ
    You can have replicas up to 15 read replicas across AZ, Cross AZ
    and Cross Region.

    You can use one of the read replicas to accessing reading operations instead
    of using the main one, it would put more workload on it.

    Read Replica replica in same region doesnt incure cost, but across region it does.
    It also used to disaster recovery.
    Zero downtime when you go to multi AZ, since snapshot would be taken
